# Git Journal — Time Travel Zine Project

## Summary
This journal documents my experience completing the Git and collaboration lab for CSE 464.

## Key Learnings
- Learned how to create and manage Git branches directly on GitHub.
- Created feature branches (`author-idea`, `review`) to simulate author/editor collaboration.
- Used pull requests to merge changes and automatically close related issues.
- Experienced how merge conflicts can occur and how to manage them through PRs.
- Created and published a tagged release (`v1.0`) with detailed release notes.

## Reflection
At first, Git commands seemed intimidating, but using GitHub’s visual interface made it intuitive.  
The process taught me real-world workflows for professional collaboration — including documentation, versioning, and release management.

I can now confidently use GitHub for:
- Branching and merging
- Tracking issues
- Reviewing pull requests
- Writing release documentation
